      "While I don't think our experience is exactly indicative of the entire Royal House experience, I have to say that we were happy with our visit. After walking around all day, we were ready to sit, and wanted a drink. We passed Royal House, noticed that there were tables open on the balcony and our decision was made. \n",
      "\n",
      "The host who helped us upstairs was great. Our interaction lasted maybe 45 seconds, but he had me laughing as he went through his whole spiel of the only rule being that we can have whatever we want as he let us pick out our table. Very nice guy, and he set the tone for great service. This was continued through our server, who took great care of us even though our ticket price was probably a bit lower than people having a full meal. Great customer service, all the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for food, we did get a bit to much on. We had a dozen oysters and fried alligator bites. Both were tasty. The portion size for the gator was tiny, but I think that's to be expected. The oysters were quite large and delicious! I cannot recall the price any more, but it was definitely reasonable. A bottle of champagne rounded things out, which I think cost somewhere in the high $30s, again reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what made this experience stand out for me was the great people watching of the balcony. We had front row seats to not only a magician but also a really great bluegrass band. I don't get a lot of street performance back home, so I definitely get a kick out of it when traveling to places like New Orleans. And personally, I think the best view to watch the French Quarter shenanigans is from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't say that Royal House was a fantastic culinary adventure or a \"best kept secret\" type of establishment, but it fit our needs perfectly and left us with some good vacation memories. I approve.\n",

      "We were seated immediately but went for a spot at the bar as that looked more fun. Very friendly and helpful bartender lady! We are trying out local foods. The oyster  duo was my favorite. The crab legs were good, really enjoyed the sauce. the shrimp were like a provençale tomato sauce, the taste of NO was definitely not our thing and we didn't even eat more than 2 bites of each part. But that might be taste. The cocktail menu is very nice and I enjoyed my drink in a nice tall glass. Overall enjoyable experience. Appreciated the free appetizer thanks to my Yelp check in.\n",

      "We were a big group and got things to share:\n",
      "-Fried Alligator: I hated the thought of eating an alligator, but the fried alligator wasn't so bad! It kind of tasted like chicken, you must try this! I wish they gave us more. It wasn't too salty but could use less...\n",
      "-Spinach Dip: Nothing fancy, the name says it all!\n",
      "-Crab claws: I really thought we were going to get \"crab claws\" instead it seems more of a soup. The dipping sauce was overwhelming and engulfs the crab claws. Extremely salty dipping sauce.\n",
      "-Seafood Pescatore: Very spicy! A great spicy kick to it, everything else was salty, but seafood was fresh\n",
      "-Baked Shrimp Tortellini: The saltiest dish ever. Don't know why the tortellinis were so salty. The shrimp in it was good, tasted very gritty. \n",
      "-Blackened Shrimp & Jambalaya: Wasn't too salty, but could use less. Shrimp was excellent and a good jambalaya, not as \"juicy\" as I would like but overall a decent dish\n",
      "-Royal House Burger: The name says it all... it wasn't too bad for a Cajun/Creole place!\n",
      "\n",
      "Over server was super cool and told us to always check the bill here because places add on extra charges (like gratuity) and not tell you around Mardi Gras. Also you get the \"Mardi Gras Menu\" aka the overly priced food because they can. I've eaten Cajun food in Cali (but not from the source-NOLA) but in Cali it's not salty like the Cajun here...so maybe it's a regional thing, but all the food was just too salty for us. Should have gotten their oysters!\n",

      "Thank you Peter D. This stop wouldn't have necessarily made it on our list except for his description of those buttery, garlicky, lemony, parmesany charbroiled oysters. On our Epic Jazz Hunt, we dropped into Royal House and ordered some wine and some snacks. Specifically the aforementioned oysters and the sauteed crab claws. \n",
      "\n",
      "Those charbroiled oysters almost caused a family feud. It was like hungry hungry hippo up in there, all of us grabbing and noshing and sopping and washing it down with a nice white. And that's all before we got to the crab claws. Those little lovelies were plump and tender, in a thick sautee that just begged to be mopped up my the fresh bread they were bringing out. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that feast of the gods, the eggplant sticks were disappointing. Not bad, just not \"oh my god I'm going to murder someone for the last bite\" good. And the muffaletta, which we saw brought out to another table, was literally the size of a bowling ball. This is a must do for everyone.\n",

      "Certainly! Here are some personalized tips for your visit to the shop:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **A Must Try**: Don’t miss out on the crab claws and the charbroiled oysters. They have received high praise from past visitors and seem to be the crowd favorites!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ordering Strategy**: If you’re aiming for a flavorful experience, you might want to skip the gumbo and instead go for the lauded redfish beignets. The savory honey sauce is said to be delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Seating Choice**: For a memorable experience, request a balcony seat. It offers great people-watching opportunities and a view of the local street performances, adding to the ambiance of your dining experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mind the Salt**: Some guests found the dishes to be on the saltier side. Don't hesitate to ask the kitchen to go easy on the salt if you’re sensitive to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sharing is Caring**: Portions like the fried alligator bites might be smaller than expected. Consider this if you plan to share dishes, and maybe order an extra item or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Happy Hour**: Check out the drink specials, and don’t forget to take advantage of any Yelp check-in offers, which might sometimes include a free appetizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Service Appreciation**: Expect friendly service here. If you're coming with a large group, heads up that the staff has been noted for their excellent customer care, making large party handling seem effortless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your visit and the culinary delights of New Orleans!\n"
